// Strict Equality (Type + Value) ensures that the type and value must match.
console.log(1 === 1);
console.log('1' === 1);



// Lose Equality (dosen't care about the types matching , if the types don't match, it will convert type of what we have in rigth side to match what we have on the left side and it will only check if the values are equal )
console.log(1 == 1);
console.log('1' == 1);
console.log(true == 1);


// Most of the time We should be using the STRICT equality , because its more precise and accurate.
