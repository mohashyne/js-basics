//We have two types of programming languages (STATIC:Statically-typed)  and (DYNAMIC: Dynamically-typed)
// e.g string name = 'Muhammd' and let name = 'Muhammad'
// to know the type of , you can type "typeof name" in console
//we don't have floating numbers or integers in javascript e.g 1, 2.1 , 0.3 are all numbers

let name = 'Muhammad'; // typeof name is a string
let age = 30;    // typeof age is a number
let isApproved = true; // typeof is Approved is a boolean
let firstName = undefined; // typeof firstName is undefined
let selectedColor = null; // "typeof selectedColor" is an object
